        <p id="roadmap-desc">To play and win at MUGMEN Bingo a PFP must be purchased for 5 SOL. Each PFP gets you a whitelist and comes with 5 Bingo cards. Each card will have its own unique features that are one of a kind. The card’s aesthetics possess an eccentric, yet vintage appeal that will last many lifetimes. There will be 75 PFP NFTS in total, which further adds to the worth of the MUGMEN NFTs through their scarcity and it being a limited edition.
        </p>
        <h2 id="roadmap-date">July 10, 2022<br>- Bingo Game Launch and Mint -
        </h2>
        <p id="roadmap-desc">Once the limited edition MUGMEN NFTs are all sold, then the launch of the Bingo Game can take place. The Bingo cards will go for 3 SOL per Bingo card.

          <h2>How will the bingo game work?</h2>
            <p id="faq-desc">70% of the money received by the sale of the bingo cards will be locked in a smart contract. 2 Sol per day will be released and 2 games per day will happen. This will go on for approximately 25 years.</p>
